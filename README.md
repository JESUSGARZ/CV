## Docs ( 🛣️ Mi experiencia con el desafío )
<details>
<summary>Create the project components #1: Analyze the project and identify its structure</summary>
<br>
it was like a kind of simple structure, but the first thing i notice is that there where some components that have some diferences in the structure so i decided to work with grid in some cases and with flex in the major of structure.

</details>

<br>

<details>
<summary>
    Add styles #2: Create the styles to give it the desired design, keep the proposed structure. 
</summary>
<br>

This is the hardest part of the project for me, because in this issue I am a very simple person , may be I  like the minimalism a lot.  But the thing is that I had to do something different, and I did it, but as you see, at my own style(minimalism).
</details>

<br>

<details>
<summary>
Create getData.js function #3: Create getData.js function to consume an API</summary>
<br>
I  created the function but as a hook, and you can find it as  useData in the folder ./src/hook, it works very good.

</details>

<br>

<details>
<summary>Integrate API #4: Start the test server and integrate the proposed information into your application.
</summary>
<pre>
&lt; json-server -w -p 4000 data.json&gt;
</pre>
<br>

Integrating the API as a .json was easy, but i had have to learn about the api context, which is an easy way to distribute the info all accross the components, it took much time, but at the end it worked.
</details>

<br>

<details>
<summary>Custom API #5:Customize the data.json file in the root of the project with your information.
 
 </summary>
<br>
Customizing the api was quick, the issue was connect it, so I used the dependency  "json-server" to create a fake API.

</details>

<br>

<details>
<summary>Document #6:Create the necessary documentation for the application in the document of your Pull Request.
 Explain in detail the steps taken, describe what were your main blocks and your solutions.
 </summary>
<br>
To document the project I chose to use  the Readme.md to explain the steps of the project.

</details>
